        <h2 id="about_bio_title">A Short Biography</h2>
        <div id="about_bio">
            <p>On December 22, 1990, a beautiful baby girl was born in the city of East Los Angeles at St.
                Marthas Hospital. Born into a family of Mexican and Nicaraguan parents, Julie grew up speaking
                Spanish. Her love of traveling started at a very young age, with her visiting her parents
                homelands during the first 10 years of her life. Throughout her life, Julie has visited 7 different
                countries. She has visited Argentina, Peru, Belize, England, Scotland, Mexico and Nicaragua.
                She plans to visit the Bahamas later this year. She has a long list of countries she would still like
                to visit, including: Japan, Ireland, Spain, Croatia, Greece, Italy, and so many more.
                After graduating from High School, Julie went to Cal State Long Beach as an Undergrad in
                Anthropology. She then went to England and attended University of Durham as a Graduate to
                continue her Anthropology studies. At the age of 26, Julie went to the University of San
                Francisco for their nursing program. At age 28, Julie became a nurse and started working at a
                local community hospital. She started working in the Medical/Surgical unit at the start of the
                pandemic and went up in acuity, meaning she started to take care of sicker patients. She went
                through Telemetry, Intensive Care Unit, and ended up at the ER. Now, she is an Emergency
                Department Nurse, where she sees all sorts of sick patients. As a new graduate working during
                the height of the pandemic really set the tone for her career. After 2 years of working as an ER
                Nurse, she decided to move into a manager role, where she works now for the VA.</p>

        <h2 id="about_interview_title">Getting to Know Julie</h2>
        <div id="about_interview">
            <h4 class="Questions">1. What's your favorite food or type of cuisine?</h4>
                <p class="Answers">My favorite type of food is Italian. I simply love pesto, parmesan cheese, and
                some good ravioli. And who doesn't love some pizza!</p>

            <h4 class="Questions">2. Do you have a favorite childhood memory?</h4>
                <p class="Answers">I have plenty of childhood memories that I love. But I guess the one that
                stands out the most and can be considered my favorite is getting on the boat
                at “It's A Small World” at Disneyland with my dad. I remember my mom and
                brothers being there, but for some reason what stands out is my dad holding
                my hand and me sitting next to him. Just has all the happy feelings attached to
                that memory.</p>

            <h4 class="Questions">3. Are you more of a morning person or a night owl?</h4>
                <p class="Answers">Definitely a night owl. I worked nights for years and now that I am working
                early mornings, I can't wait to go back to nights.</p>

            <h4 class="Questions">4. What's a fun fact about yourself that most people don't know?</h4>
                <p class="Answers">I can roll my tongue into a little taco. Why is that a fun fact? Well let me tell
                you, see there is a genetic trait that allows you to do this and well not
                everyone carries this genetic trait. So I think that's a little fun genetic fact.</p>

            <h4 class="Questions">5. Do you have any pets? If so, tell me about them.</h4>
                <p class="Answers">I do, I have 3 dogs! Two German Shepards and a Lhasa-Poo. The Germans
                are one male, names Bruno and a female named Coco. Bruno is 7 years old
                and Coco is 4 years old. The Lhasa-poo is now 10 years old, but you wouldn't
                even know it, she plays like a little energetic puppy.</p>

            <h4 class="Questions">6. What's your go-to activity when you want to unwind?</h4>
                <p class="Answers">Either sleep or shopping. They both make me equally happy.</p>

            <h4 class="Questions">7. If you could learn any skill instantly, what would it be?</h4>
                <p class="Answers">How to cook. Don't get me wrong, I can make the simplest of dishes, but I
                would love to cook like a Michelin star chef.</p>

            <h4 class="Questions">8. What's your favorite holiday and why?</h4>
                <p class="Answers">I think it would have to be Christmas Eve. This is when the entire family
                gathers around, eats really delicious food (that I don't cook), and just get to
                spend time. Plus it's cold outside and just get to cuddle in a nice warm
                clothing. And then open gifts at midnight.</p>

            <h4 class="Questions">9. Do you prefer the beach, the mountains, or the city for a vacation?</h4>
                <p class="Answers">I think this is such a difficult question. I guess it really depends on what type
                of vacation I want. If I feel like exploring then I would do a city. If I want
                cool weather to just relax, with minimal walking/hiking, sure a cabin in the
                mountains. With a nice lake nearby to go fishing. Now if I really want to
                relax and drink lovely cocktails, then the beach for sure.</p>

            <h4 class="Questions">10. What's the last TV show or movie you watched, and did you like it?</h4>
                <p class="Answers">It was a true crime documentary about a young lady that hired a
                hitman to kill her parents. All because she felt that they were too strict and
                she wanted some freedom. Did I like it? I mean...it was interesting to hear
                about this truly sad story. The lengths that some people are driven to in order
                to feel like they can finally obtain what they want. The human mind/psyche is
                really interesting and to hear how different people act to different situations,
                is quite fascinating.</p>
