                            During warm California summer days, Julie enjoys being on the water with friends.
                            Her passion for paddleboarding began when she spontaneously decided to stop by
                            a board rental shop, and she decided to rent one. Now, paddleboarding is a peaceful
                            ritual that keeps her away from the heat.

                            Just like Julie enjoys being on the beach at home, when she decides to travel, it's always
                            somewhere with a coast. She always finds a way to feel at home when at the beach.

                            Julie has always been curious about fishing. It wasn't until her boyfriend took her fishing one day, that
                            she herself got hooked. Although, she still will not touch the fish, so she needs someone to get the fish off
                            the line for her.
